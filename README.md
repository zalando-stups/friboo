**Friboo** is a lightweight utility library for writing microservices in Clojure. It provides several components that you can use with Stuart Sierra's [Component lifecycle framework](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component).

Friboo encourages an "API First" approach based on the [Swagger specification](http://swagger.io/). As such, the REST API is defined as YAML.

## Leiningen dependency

    [org.zalando.stups/friboo 1.9.0]

## Why Friboo?

- Friboo allows you to first define your API in a portable, language-agnostic format, and then implement it (with the help of [swagger1st](https://github.com/sarnowski/swagger1st)).
- It contains ready-made components/building blocks for your applications: An HTTP server, DB access layer, an audit log (in case you have compliance requirements to follow), and more. See [helpful components](#helpful-components).
- It does OAuth 2.0 access token checking out of the box.
- It contains the "glue code" for you, and there is already a recommended way of doing things.

## Development Status

Friboo is used in production by numerous services in Zalando; see the list at the end of this page. However, there is always room for improvement, so we're very much open to contributions. For more details, see our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and check the Issues Tracker for ways you can help.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/)

### Starting a New Project
To start a new project based on Friboo, use the Leiningen template:

    $ lein new friboo <project>

This will generate a sample project containing some "foobar" logic that can serve as a starting point in your experiments.

A new directory with the `<project>` name will be created in the current directory, containing the following files:

```
friboo-is-awesome
├── Dockerfile
├── README.md
├── db.sh
├── dev
│   └── user.clj
├── dev-config.edn
├── project.clj
├── resources
│   ├── api
│   │   └── api.yaml
│   └── db
│       ├── migration
│       │   └── V1__initial_schema.sql
│       └── queries.sql
├── src
│   └── friboo_is_awesome
│       ├── api.clj
│       ├── core.clj
│       └── db.clj
└── test
    └── friboo_is_awesome
        ├── api_test.clj
        └── core_test.clj
```

* `Dockerfile` contains basic instructions for packaging the uberjar into a Docker image.
* `README.md` contains some pregenerated development tips for the new project.
* `db.sh` contains handy scripts to run a PostgreSQL database in a Docker container for development and integration testing.
* `dev/user.clj` contains functions for [Reloaded Workflow](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2013/06/04/clojure-workflow-reloaded).
* `dev-config.edn` contains environment variables that will be used during reloaded workflow (instead of putting them into `profiles.clj`).
* `project.clj` contains the project definition with all dependencies and some additional plugins.
* `resources/api.yaml` contains the [Swagger API definition](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) in .yaml format.
* `resources/db/migration/V1__initial_schema.sql` contains some DDL for the example (used by the [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) library).
* `resources/db/queries.sql` contains sample queries for the app (used by the [Yesql](https://github.com/krisajenkins/yesql) library).
* the `src` directory contains these components:
	* `core.clj` is the [system](https://github.com/stuartsierra/component#systems) definition.
	* `api.clj` contains API endpoint handlers.
	* `db.clj` contains generated functions for accessing the database.
* the `test` directory contains unit test examples using both `clojure.test` and [Midje](https://github.com/marick/Midje).

### Configuration Options

In `dev/user.clj`, you can use `:system-log-level` to set the root logger to something other than `INFO`.

## Helpful Components

### HTTP Component

The `def-http-component` macro generates the HTTP component on demand. You can define which dependencies your
API functions require:

```clojure
(ns myapi
  (:require [org.zalando.stups.friboo.system.http :refer [def-http-component]))

(def-http-component MyAPI "my-api.yaml" [db scheduler])

(defn my-api-function [parameters request db scheduler]
  ; your implementation that can use 'db' as well as 'scheduler' dependencies
  )
```

The first argument of your function will always be a flattened map (parameter name -> parameter value) without `in`
categorisation. This violates the Swagger spec, which calls parameter names only unique in combination with your
`in` type, so be cautious when modelling your API.

The HTTP component is dependent upon a few other components (audit-log, metrics), so we recommend that you use the
convenience function to create an HTTP system:

```clojure
(ns my-app.core
  (:require [org.zalando.stups.friboo.config :as config]
            [org.zalando.stups.friboo.system :as system])

(defn run
  [default-configuration]
  (let [configuration (config/load-configuration
                         (system/default-http-namespaces-and :db)
                         [my-app.sql/default-db-configuration
                          my-app.api/default-http-configuration
                          default-configuration])
        system (system/http-system-map configuration
                  my-app.api/map->API [:db]
                  :db (my-app.sql/map->DB {:configuration (:db configuration)}))]

    (system/run configuration system)))
```

#### Configuration Options

Initialize the component with its configuration in the `:configuration` key:

    (map->MyAPI {:configuration {:port        8080
                                 :cors-origin "*.zalando.de"}})

* you may set `:cors-origin` to a domain mask for CORS access (e.g., `*.zalando.de`).
* These are all the [configuration options](https://ring-clojure.github.io/ring/ring.adapter.jetty.html) that Jetty supports.

#### OAuth 2.0 access token checking

You can provide a `TOKENINFO_URL` environment variable with a value like this:

    https://auth.example.com/oauth2/tokeninfo

Then the HTTP component will require every incoming request to have the `Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>` header. It will validate the token using the specified URL (`GET https://auth.example.com/oauth2/tokeninfo?access_token=<ACCESS_TOKEN>`).

### Database Component

The `def-db-component` macro generates the DB component on demand. The component is itself a `db-spec`-compliant data structure backed by a connection pool:

```clojure
(ns mydb
  (:require [org.zalando.stups.friboo.system.db :refer [def-db-component]))

(def-db-component MyDB)
```

#### Configuration Options

Initialize the component with its configuration in the `:configuration` key:

    (map->MyDB {:configuration {:subprotocol "postgresql"
                                :subname     "localhost/mydb"}})

TODO link to jdbc documentation, pool specific configuration like min- and max-pool-size

### Audit Log Component (Deprecated, see next section)

The audit log component aims to collect logs of all modifying HTTP requests (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and 
store them in an S3 bucket. You can then use this information to create an audit trail.

**Will be removed in a future release!**

#### Configuration Options

* Set `:audit-log-bucket` to enable this component
    * the value should address the name of an S3 bucket
    * the application must have write access to this bucket
    * adjust the frequency with which the log files are written with `:audit-log-flush-millis` (defaults to 10s)
        * no empty files will be written
    * to build a meaningful file name pattern, use the environment variables `APPLICATION_ID`, `APPLICATION_VERSION`
      and `INSTANCE_ID`
        * `INSTANCE_ID` defaults to random UUID

### New Audit Logger Components

Since the old audit log component does not suit our needs anymore, we introduce new audit log components
that you have to explicitly call with clojure maps, which get serialized to JSON and shipped somewhere.
Currently there are S3 and HTTP shippers.

### Metrics Component

The metrics component initializes a [Dropwizard MetricsRegistry](http://metrics.dropwizard.io) to measure
frequency and performance of the Swagger API endpoints; see [HTTP component](#http-component).

### Management HTTP component

This component starts another embedded Jetty at a different port (default 7979) and exposes endpoints used to monitor and manage the application:

* `/metrics`: A JSON document containing all metrics, gathered by the metrics component
* `/hystrix.stream`: The [Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix) stream (can be aggregated by [Turbine](https://github.com/Netflix/Turbine))
* `/monitor/monitor.html`: The Hystrix dashboard

#### Configuration Options

All Jetty configuration options are prefixed with `:mgmt-http-` or `MGMT_HTTP_`. 

## Real-World Usage

There are multiple examples of real-world usages of Friboo, including among Zalando's STUPS components:

* [Pier One Docker registry](https://github.com/zalando-stups/pierone) (REST service with DB and S3 backend)
* [Kio application registry](https://github.com/zalando-stups/kio) (REST service with DB)
* [Even SSH access granting service](https://github.com/zalando-stups/even) (REST service with DB)
* [Essentials](https://github.com/zalando-stups/essentials) (REST service with DB)
* [Hello world example](https://github.com/dryewo/friboo-hello-world-full) (project that served as base for the Leiningen template)

TODO HINT: set java.util.logging.manager= org.apache.logging.log4j.jul.LogManager to have proper JUL logging.
